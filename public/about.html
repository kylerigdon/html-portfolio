<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, thank you for taking the time to look at my first portfolio. I am a self taught web developer who has enjoyed learning so many new things and I am looking forward to working hard to further my knowledge of development.</p>

<p>Other than coding, I enjoy the time I get with my family (Wife, daughter and dog). My other hobbies that I enjoy in my free time are gaming whether it's tabletop gaming or more recently PC gaming. I've also started getting back into reading. Currently i'm working on finishing The Blade Itself.</p>
